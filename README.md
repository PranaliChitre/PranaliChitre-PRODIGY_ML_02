In the realm of customer segmentation, K-means clustering emerges as a powerful tool in unsupervised machine learning. The algorithm partitions customer datasets into distinct clusters, leveraging features like purchase behavior or demographic information. Initiated by selecting the number of clusters (K) and randomly placing centroids, the algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the closest cluster and updates centroids based on mean values. Sensitivity to initial centroid placement and the need to predefine K are considerations, yet K-means excels in efficiency and scalability. By understanding customer similarities, businesses can tailor strategies, enhancing personalization and engagement. Despite its assumptions of spherical clusters, K-means clustering proves invaluable in reshaping marketing strategies and optimizing customer experiences.
